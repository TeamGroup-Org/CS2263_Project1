# CS2263_Project1 - Acquire

## About

This project is a fully functional computer game version of the game [Acquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire), a game about hotels, stocks, and making money.

### Minimum Viable Product:
- Two players sharing a system will be able to play together hotseat style.
- All game data can be saved to a file and loaded from a file at runtime.
- Will, without errors or diverging from the rules of the physical game (consistent game logic), be able to handle player turns, merges, stocks, and banking.
- Will have a GUI
- Will be designed with 3 or more design patterns evident.

## Getting Started

This is a Gradle project, which requires end users to have an up to date Gradle installation to run it.

### Windows

Open *Command Prompt* and set your current directory to the project location.

Next, run:
```
>gradle build
```

And then launch the GUI by using:
```
>gradle run
```

## Usage
From the home screen you can begin a new game, ~~load one from a locally stored file~~ (NOT FUNCTIONAL YET), or exit the program.

Beginning a new game brings you to the game view of the application, where there is a gameboard, ~~player turn indicator, player hand and stock counts, as well as money totals and the ability to bring up various information.~~ (NOT FUNCTIONAL YET)
